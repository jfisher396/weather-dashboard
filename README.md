### About

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

### User Story

    AS A traveler
    I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
    SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    WHEN I search for a city
    THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
    WHEN I view the UV index
    THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
    WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
    WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
    WHEN I open the weather dashboard
    THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast

### Data

The application uses the following data inputs:
* Weather information is provided by the OpenWeather [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). [Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api) can be found here.


### Build

* In HTML semantic tags have been used to aid with accessibility.
* The site is built using Bulma CSS framework.
   * The use of Bulma minimises the need for media queries. 
   * See [Bulma documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/) for customizing the site with their provided options
* [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) powers the dynamic rendering of the html content based on user input
* [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) is used to manipulate date values for historic data extraction from APIs
